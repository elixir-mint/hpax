HPax is an Elixir implementation of the HPACK header compression algorithm as used in HTTP/2 and
defined in RFC 7541. HPax is (or will soon be) used by several Elixir projects, including the
[Mint](https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint) HTTP client and
[bandit](https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit) HTTP server projects.

## Installation

To install HPax, add it to your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:hpax, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then, run `$ mix deps.get`.

## Usage

HPax is designed to be used in both encoding and decoding scenarios. In both cases, a context is
used to maintain state internal to the HPACK algorithm. In the common use case of using HPax
within HTTP/2, this context must be shared between any subsequent encoding/decoding calls within
an endpoint. Note that the contexts used for encoding and decoding within HTTP/2 are completely
distinct from one another, even though they are structurally identical.

To encode a set of headers into a binary with HPax:

```elixir
ctx = HPax.new(4096)
headers = [{:store, ":status", "201"}, {:store, "location", "http://example.com"}]
{encoded_headers, ctx} = HPax.encode(headers, ctx)
#=> {iodata, updated_context}
```

To decode a binary into a set of headers with HPax:

```elixir
ctx = HPax.new(4096)
encoded_headers = <<...>>
{:ok, headers, ctx} = HPax.decode(encoded_headers, ctx)
#=> {:ok, [{:store, ":status", "201"}, {:store, "location", "http://example.com"}], updated_context}
```

For complete usage information, please see the HPax [documentation](https://hex.pm/packages/hpax).
